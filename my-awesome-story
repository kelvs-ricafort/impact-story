I was born a mild spastic diplegic cerebral palsy to an engineer father and a housewife for a mother. We are 2 children in the family. I am
the eldest, my younger sister is born one year after me. I was a bookworm when i was a child.

During my elementary days, I was excelling at english, and science, though I hated Mathematics. I survived elementay school with the help of
my teachers who tutored me and my parents who are supporting me in my endeavour.

During my high school days I realized I was fascinated by computers (my younger sister has computer class on her school). Music was my outlet
when I am stressed and I would pick up my guitar and sing a song until my stress levels are gone.

This led me to a bachelor's degree in computer programming course in college at AMA Computer Learning Center. Where I graduated at 2007. I
went out for a 6 year hiatus before joining my first company.

During April 28, 2013 I searched the internet for an online job because I am tired of playing games and doing nothing.
My college classmate Patrick Tan introduced me to Genashtim and ask me to try out in the company. And I did wht he said
I whipped up my resum√© and sent to their HR and after a few days I was ask for an interview.
